# LMSdb - Library Management System Database

LMSdb is a database structure developed for managing a Library Management System. It focuses on organizing, managing, and tracking resources such as books, users, borrowing history, and other critical library functions. This project aims to create a scalable and efficient database to support library operations effectively.

## Features

- **Book Management**: Handles information about books, including titles, authors, genres, publication details, and availability status.
- **User Management**: Stores user details (library members and staff), including personal information, registration status, and user roles (admin, librarian, member).
- **Borrowing and Returning**: Tracks borrowing activities, return due dates, and fine calculations for late returns.
- **Categories and Tags**: Organizes books by categories and allows tagging for easier discovery and classification.
- **Reservations**: Allows users to reserve books that are currently checked out by other members.
- **Fines and Penalties**: Automatically tracks late return penalties and keeps records of fine payments.
- **Reports and Logs**: Generates reports on user activity, popular books, and borrowing trends.

## Database Design

The database is designed using PostgreSQL, ensuring proper normalization and referential integrity. It features relationships between tables like `Books`, `Users`, `Borrowings`, and `Categories` to optimize library workflows and maintain accuracy in data management.

## Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL**: The relational database used to manage library data.
- **PDO (PHP Data Objects)**: Used for efficient and secure database interactions.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/4l0ne4ever/LMSdb.git

2. Set up a PostgreSQL database and update the connection details in your projectâ€™s environment configuration.
3. Run the database migrations to create the required tables.
4. Populate the database with sample data for testing and development.
